### About
This is a Node.js app that uses MySQL to store, display and update products listed "for sale".

### How to Use
Initiate the app to view "for sale" items and their details including price, department and stock quantity. Enter the corresponding unique ID for the item you would like to buy and the number of units desired when prompted. If there is sufficient quantity in stock, the total price of order is displayed, followed by the "for sale" table with updated stock quantity. If not, you will see "Insufficient quantity" in the console and the table and prompts are regenerated.
